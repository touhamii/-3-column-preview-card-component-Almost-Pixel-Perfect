_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- I submited this just to check how my solution will be displayed on the DESIGN COMPARISON feature on FrontEndMentor 
because im trying to get a pixel perfect design.

### What I learned 

- How to properly use (margin auto) in Flexbox (the 3 buttons were not in same line in certain screen resolutions).

- Some techniques to use in the future when trying to get that pixel perfect design. 

- There is more difference than I expected between theory and practise espicially how time consuming that was for a simple challenge.

- It's a different feeling to get the job done without asking for any help i took it seriously i challenged myself it took me like 6 days so i had those moments where i just didnt know what's wrong or how to achieve something with code but never gave up.

- I liked CSS more than i thought i would, I jumped here instead of other coding paths cuz i wanted to create a website for my father but im felling in love with it the more i code.
